# This includes the limitations of QC:
## the limitations of quantum computers prevent them from being used to perform multiplication in a practical way at the present time

1- they have a number of limitations that prevent them from being used to perform multiplication in a practical way.
2- Time needed for run is longer than the time nedded for Classical computers to do this.
3- they are very noisy. This means that errors are often introduced into the computation, which can make it difficult to get accurate results.
4- Quantum computers are still in their early stages of development
