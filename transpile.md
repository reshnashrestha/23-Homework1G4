# Quantum Circuit Documentation

## Overview

This documentation provides an explanation of the quantum circuit implemented using Qiskit and visualized using the IBM Quantum Composer widget. The circuit performs various quantum operations on a 7-qubit quantum register and measures the final state of one qubit into a classical register.

## Quantum Circuit Description

The implemented quantum circuit consists of the following steps:

1. Initialization:
   - Create a 7-qubit quantum register (`qreg_q`) and a 1-bit classical register (`creg_c0`).
   2. Quantum Gate Operations:
   - Apply a rotational gate `rz(pi/2)` on qubit `qreg_q[1]`.
   - Apply the `sx` (square root of X) gate on qubit `qreg_q[1]`.
   - Apply a rotational gate `rz(3*pi/4)` on qubit `qreg_q[1]`.
   - Perform similar gate operations on qubits `qreg_q[3]` and `qreg_q[5]`.

3. Entanglement and Controlled Operations:
   - Create entanglement between qubits `qreg_q[3]` and `qreg_q[5]`.
   - Perform a series of controlled-X (`cx`) gate operations on qubits `qreg_q[1]` and `qreg_q[3]` and qubits `qreg_q[5]` and `qreg_q[3]`.

4. Measurement:
   - Measure the final state of qubit `qreg_q[5]` into classical register `creg_c0[0]`.

5. Visualization:
   - The quantum circuit can be visualized interactively using the IBM Quantum Composer widget.
   ## IBM Quantum Composer Widget

The IBM Quantum Composer widget is used to visualize the constructed quantum circuit. It provides a graphical representation of the circuit, allowing users to explore the quantum gates and their interactions.

## Usage

To run and visualize the quantum circuit:
1. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, including Qiskit and the IBM Quantum widgets.
2. Execute the provided code to create the quantum circuit and visualize it using the IBM Quantum Composer widget.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides an overview of the quantum circuit implemented using Qiskit and the IBM Quantum Composer widget. The circuit showcases various quantum gate operations and illustrates the principles of quantum computing.
