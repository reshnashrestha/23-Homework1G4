 Quantum Circuit Visualization Using IBM Quantum Widgets

In this example, we will create a quantum circuit and visualize it using the IBM Quantum Experience's `ibm_quantum_widgets` library and Qiskit. The circuit consists of various quantum gates and measurements.

## Importing Libraries

```python
from ibm_quantum_widgets import CircuitComposer
from qiskit import QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit
from numpy import pi
CircuitComposer is used for visualizing the quantum circuit.
QuantumRegister and ClassicalRegister are used to define quantum and classical registers.
QuantumCircuit is used to create a quantum circuit.
numpy is imported to use the value of pi.
Quantum Register and Classical Register Initialization

qreg_q = QuantumRegister(7, 'q')
creg_c0 = ClassicalRegister(1, 'c0')
qreg_q is a quantum register named 'q' with 7 qubits.
creg_c0 is a classical register named 'c0' with 1 bit.
Quantum Circuit Initialization

circuit = QuantumCircuit(qreg_q, creg_c0)
circuit is an instance of the QuantumCircuit class created using the quantum and classical registers.
Quantum Circuit Operations
Here, we perform a series of quantum operations on the quantum circuit, including gates and measurements. The circuit's operations are as follows:

Apply an X gate (bit-flip gate) to qubit qreg_q[1].
Apply an Rz gate with an angle of π/2 to qubit qreg_q[3].
Apply an Sx (square root of X) gate to qubit qreg_q[3].
Apply another Rz gate with an angle of π/2 to qubit qreg_q[3].
Apply a CNOT gate (controlled-X gate) with qreg_q[1] as the control qubit and qreg_q[3] as the target qubit.
Apply an Rz gate with an angle of -π/4 to qubit qreg_q[3].
Apply another CNOT gate, this time with qreg_q[5] as the control qubit and qreg_q[3] as the target qubit.
Apply an Rz gate with an angle of π/4 to qubit qreg_q[3].
Apply another CNOT gate with qreg_q[1] as the control qubit and qreg_q[3] as the target qubit.
Apply an Rz gate with an angle of π/4 to qubit qreg_q[1].

Apply an Sx gate to qubit qreg_q[3].
Apply an Rz gate with an angle of -3π/2 to qubit qreg_q[3].
Apply an Sx gate to qubit qreg_q[5].
Apply a CNOT gate with qreg_q[3] as the control qubit and qreg_q[5] as the target qubit.
Apply an Sx gate to qubit qreg_q[3].
Apply an Rz gate with an angle of π/2 to qubit qreg_q[5].
Apply another CNOT gate with qreg_q[3] as the control qubit and qreg_q[5] as the target qubit.
Apply an Rz gate with an angle of -π to qubit qreg_q[3].
Apply an Sx gate to qubit qreg_q[3].
Apply an Rz gate with an angle of -π/4 to qubit qreg_q[3].
Apply a CNOT gate with qreg_q[3] as the control qubit and qreg_q[1] as the target qubit.
Apply an Rz gate with an angle of -π/4 to qubit qreg_q[1].
Apply another CNOT gate with qreg_q[3] as the control qubit and qreg_q[1] as the target qubit.
Apply an Rz gate with an angle of 3π/4 to qubit qreg_q[5].
